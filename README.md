# Problems In Painting

## Contrast Effect

Given what we know about [Simultaneous Contrast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect), how are we supposed to use these things?

Corel Painter's "Temporal Colors Palette" gets it somewhat better, as it shows the new color superimposed on your painting as a round "swatch".  However, the interface and the vivid color wheel still impose a significant Contrast Effect upon your color picking decisions:

It seems that it's impossible to select a color from an interface without the interface also influencing the color selection.  So, why don't we get rid of the interface and allow the color selection to be influenced by the context within the actual painting?  We can place little swatches of color directly on our painting; just like getting paint samples from the home improvement store!

The only problem now is the interface has to exist somewhere and be operable even when you're not looking at it.  Fortunately, we've long ago invented keyboards with a whole array of buttons to choose from.  We can map some buttons to adjust our colors in whatever dimensions we choose.  Hue is an obvious dimension.  What about brightness and saturation?  Then it gets a bit more complicated.
